Lead by Vitalik Buterin and his team of developers, Ethereum was created, which has grown to become the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap. Ethereum is currently Proof of Work (PoW), similar to Bitcoin, but will be moving to Proof of Stake (PoS), in the next 12-18 months. Ethereum is used by a large majority of coins due to the usability and popularized blockchain that has been developed. Although Ethereum does have its downsides, it is sure to be a project that is here for the long term.</p><h2 id=what-problem-is-it-solving>What Problem Is It Solving?</h2><p>Like all other smart contract platforms, Ethereum is fighting to maintain its market share in the space. Smart contracts will be the infrastructure of mainstream blockchain adoption, and the leader of the smart contracts will give the best ROI. Currently, that leader is Ethereum, but it can easily and swiftly change. Picking the leading smart contract blockchain is similar to picking the Google, Microsoft, or Apple of the dot com bubble. The cryptocurrency space is still very new and has a long way to go in terms of real-world adoption. I believe that there will be multiple winners in the blockchain space, but a very small portion of cryptocurrencies you see today will be around in the next 5,10, or even 20 years. Smart contracts will be used for everything, from supply chain management to decentralized finance (DeFi), and betting one of the winners is no easy task.</p><h2 id=the-development-team>The Development Team</h2><p>When Ethereum was first created, it was designed by a few key members. These members include Vitalik Buterin, Anthony Di, Charles Hoskinson, Mihai Alisie, and Amir Chetrit (the initial 5) in December 2013. Joseph Lubin, Gavin Wood, & Jeffrey Wilcke were added in early 2014 as founders. While most of these members have left Ethereum to develop their own blockchains and technologies, they have all been successful in doing so. A common comparison made is between the original Ethereum team and the Paypal Mafia. Both groups have created a very prominent technology, and then branched off to all be successful in their own areas. A few examples of this on Ethereum&rsquo;s side are Charles Hoskinson, who has founded IOHK and Cardano, Dr. Gavin Wood, the founder of Polkadot, Mihai Alise, the founder of Akasha, and so many more. While most of these members left to build their own technologies, the fact that it was built by these individuals is proof of itself that it will be here for the long term.</p><h2 id=upcoming-events-and-news>Upcoming Events and News</h2><p>Ethereum has a couple of major upcoming upgrades that are sure to bring a positive impact upon its blockchain. One of these upgrades is the London Hard Fork (EIP 1159), which is supposed to be implemented sometime in July or August. The main change with EIP 1159 is Ethereum will become a deflationary coin. To put it in simpler terms, Ethereum fees will be split into two. One of these fees will be burned, while the other fee will go to the miners. The problem with this is the miners will lose out on that fee that will be burned, which results in a large dip in the money the miners are making. In response to this, the miners planned a strike against this upgrade but failed. As Ethereum becomes a deflationary coin, supply will gradually lower, which is very bullish for its price. Another big upgrade planned for Ethereum will be occurring within the next 12-18 months. This upgrade will convert Ethereum from PoW to PoS. Coins following the PoW consensus model have been getting a lot of negative press, due to the environmental impact and the large amount of energy that is consumed to mine these coins. PoS is an overall better option for the consensus model of Ethereum. PoS will help with scaling Ethereum, decrease gas fees, and be better for the environment. More updates on this upgrade will be presented as the upgrade date approaches.</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=/website-investing/posts/what-is-pancakeswap/ rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is PancakeSwap (CAKE)?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=/website-investing/posts/what-are-smart-contracts/ rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is a Smart Contract?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-search widget"><form class=widget-search__form role=search method=get action=https://google.com/search><label><input class=widget-search__field type=search placeholder=SEARCH… name=q aria-label=SEARCH…></label>
