Matic is built upon Ethereum and is used by developers to launch their own custom blockchain that is compatible with Ethereum. The goal of Matic is a world of blockchains that are easily able to exchange information. This project was once called the Matic Network, but recently re-branded and is now known as Polygon. Matic itself is the scaling solution to Ethereuum, while Polygon is the infrastructure for this network of blockchains.</p><h2 id=what-problem-is-it-solving>What Problem Is It Solving?</h2><p>Scaling is a big problem on the Ethereum network, and Matic aims to solve that. High fees, as well as high transaction times, are a big problem on the current Ethereum network, and Matic can help solve these 2 problems. If you want to send Ethereum from one wallet to another, it is very costly to the average investor. In April of 2021, these simple transaction fees were an average of 10-30 dollars, and sometimes much higher. This is nothing compared to the cost of a smart contract transaction, which peaked at well over 600 dollars. Ethereum also doesn&rsquo;t have a high amount of transactions per second, coming in at a measly 30. Matic aims to solve these problems with their layer 2 scaling solutions.</p><h2 id=the-development-team>The Development Team</h2><p>Polygon is led by its 4 co-founders Sandeep Nailwal, Anurag Arjun, Mihailo Bjelic, Jaynti Kanani. These four have a combination of experience in the blockchain space, as well as knowledge of growing tech firms. The Advisory Board has members from big names like Ethereum and Coinbase. This is a promising team that has done a fantastic job so far developing and leading this project to where it is currently. This team is by no means finished and there is still a lot to prove.</p><h2 id=upcoming-events-and-news>Upcoming Events and News</h2><p>There are plenty of upcoming events for Matic, such as zK Rollups, Optimistic Rollups, Validum Chains, Sidechains, and Enterprise Chains. All of these upgrades will further expand the capabilities and reach of Matic. While there is no exact date on when these upgrades will be implemented, these events are sure to have a big impact on Matic&rsquo;s future. This is a project that could be here for the long term if it can seize Ethereum developers that are annoyed with the non-scalable blockchain that is Ethereum. While Matic is still yet to fully prove itself as a project that will be here years from now, there is a lot of potential for this project and is sure to be a token to keep your eye on.</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=/website-investing/posts/what-are-smart-contracts/ rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is a Smart Contract?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=/website-investing/posts/what-is-dogecoin/ rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is Dogecoin (DOGE)?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-search widget"><form class=widget-search__form role=search method=get action=https://google.com/search><label><input class=widget-search__field type=search placeholder=SEARCH… name=q aria-label=SEARCH…></label>
