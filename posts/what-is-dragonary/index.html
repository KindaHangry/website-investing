You start with 3 free common dragons, and you can mine CYT with those dragons, earning a small amount per day. Once you have your 3 common dragons to at least 1/2 of their max level, you can breed them. This does cost CYT, which is Dragonary&rsquo;s native token. Once you breed your common dragons enough, you can get an uncommon. Your mining rewards increase with each rarity. You can repeat this process to reach even higher rarities. Once you get to the 3rd rarity, which is rare, the dragons you get are NFTs, which you can sell on the marketplace. Currently, the marketplace isn&rsquo;t out yet, but it will be out soon.</p><h2 id=can-you-earn-money>Can You Earn Money?</h2><p>In Dragonary, you have 2 ways of leveling up. Your daily rewards which give you CYT, the quantity is decided by the rarity of your dragons. The other way is breeding dragons that are rare or higher, to eventually sell on the NFT marketplace. So yes, you can earn money playing this game. Currently, unless you have a rare dragon or above, you won&rsquo;t make much. So technically you can make money without putting anything in, but it won&rsquo;t be anything substantial. If you are willing to put in enough money to get to a rare dragon, this may be a great game to earn some money on. Since this game is still very early, there isn&rsquo;t much you can do in-game, but with future updates, they plan to change this.</p><h2 id=the-teamroadmap>The Team/Roadmap</h2><p>With Dragonary being such a new game, their team and roadmap are very important. We need to know if the team is trustworthy and if they can hit their goals. Dragonary does have a public team, which is always a good sign. This means they are less likely to rug pull or give up on the project since their names are attached. According to their whitepaper, their team does seem to have experience in their respective fields and was able to put together a quality game. They also have an aggressive roadmap, with goals of still creating a PVP Arena, having an Island Sale, a major update with 2 new base dragons for each element, new missions, new enemies, clans, and more. Also, a Coinary Day is planned, but there isn&rsquo;t much information on what exactly that will be. So far, they have been able to hit these marks, and have been able to update the game frequently. This game is very interconnected with the community and quickly fixing bugs as they come out. Their team does seem to care about the game and its future, which is why I believe in it.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Dragonary is a very new game, meaning it may have a lot more upside or downside, depending on how the game continues to grow. I find this game fun and rewarding, for being a free-to-play game. Although you do need to spend money to make any significant income, it may be worth it. Overall, this game is led by a team who cares and frequently updates and has play to earn, which is why there is so much potential in this game.</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=/website-investing/posts/what-is-splinterlands/ rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is Splinterlands?
