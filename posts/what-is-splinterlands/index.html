It’s recently grown in popularity, and today we’re going to talk about what Splinterlands is, if you can make money off of it, and much more.</p><h2 id=what-is-splinterlands>What is Splinterlands?</h2><p>Splinterlands is a strategy game that involves using cards to defeat your opponents. You can play on desktop and mobile, making it widely accessible. There are currently ranked matches, seasons, and even tournaments, giving the player a variety of things to do. If you want to sign up, I&rsquo;ve attached a link to their website where you can <a href="https://splinterlands.com?ref=kindahangry">sign up</a> for free.</p><h2 id=can-you-earn-money>Can You Earn Money?</h2><p>Splinterlands has a variety of ways to make money, with a very low barrier to entry. There is a $10 fee to purchase the Summoner’s Spellbook, which is essential for the play to earn aspect of this game. Once you get this, you have a variety of options to earn. First of all, you can earn through simply winning matches. Winning matches will give you a small amount of Dark Energy Crystals (DEC), which is the games main currency. DEC is also a crypto currency that you can sell on the open market. There are no limit to the amount of games that you can play, but you will receive less the more games you play each day. This is a way to make money, but you won’t make anything crazy from this method. The next way to make money from this game is from tournaments. Splinterlands does host tournaments for cash prizes, although it is very difficult to win anything. This isn’t a great option for the average player, but is still an option. Finally, you can buy/sell/rent cards, which is the best way to make money. You can buy cards you want to make your deck stronger, or if you feel they will increase in price. You can also get cards through chests, which you get from the season pass and your daily quests. These cards can be worth a lot of money, depending on what you get. Once you have a card from a chest, you can either sell or rent that card out. If you sell it, you will receive what it is worth at that time, but you will lose ownership of it. If you rent it, you still own the card, and the renter pays you a daily amount. Overall, with such a small barrier to entry, this is one of the best games to play to earn.</p><h2 id=the-teamroadmap>The Team/Roadmap</h2><p>Splinterlands does seem to have a solid team. First of all, they aren’t anonymous, which means they aren’t as likely to do something fishy. Secondly, they do have a background in blockchain and gaming, which is great because they have a viewpoint both as a developer, but also a player. They have also been developing this game for years, and have been upgrading it since 2018. Splinterlands has an aggressive roadmap for 2021 and beyond, with plenty of upgrades they plan on doing. <a href=https://docs.splinterlands.com/timeline/roadmap>Here</a> you can see what exactly they plan on changing.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Overall, Splinterlands has been steadily improving over the past few years, and seems that it will continue to do so. The game is lead by a team that understands what it takes to make a great game, and have an aggressive future roadmap. There are some fantastic play to earn mechanics in this game for such a low entry fee, and it may be one of the best out there. In conclusion, there is definitely a lot of potential with this game, and is one to check out.</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=/website-investing/posts/what-is-crypto-gaming/ rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is Crypto Gaming?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=/website-investing/posts/what-is-dragonary/ rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is Dragonary?
