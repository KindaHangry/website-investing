Today we&rsquo;ll talk about some ways to make passive income in crypto and how to actually do it.</p><h2 id=how-can-i-make-passive-income>How Can I Make Passive Income?</h2><p>Well in cryptocurrency, there are plenty of good ways to make some passive income. The top ways to make passive income that I&rsquo;d recommend is staking, lending, mining, and gaming.</p><h2 id=what-is-staking>What is Staking?</h2><p>This doesn&rsquo;t apply to all cryptocurrencies, but it does apply to a lot, especially of recent. Staking works by people pooling together tokens of a specific cryptocurrency, and verifying the network with that pool. Through verifying the network, you are rewarded in the native token. Staking is great for coins you plan on holding for a while, because you&rsquo;ll always be making passive income off of it. On the other hand, the more people that stake that coin, the less of a reward you&rsquo;ll get. Either way, it&rsquo;s passive income you&rsquo;re getting for free just by holding a token you believe in. There is a way to get even more rewards, through liquidity pools. Liquidity pools require you to hold 2 specified tokens and stake them on a decentralized exchange (DEX). For example, you could provide liquidity for a the BNB/BUSD pair on Pancake Swap, and if you stake both of those tokens you will be rewarded.\</p><h2 id=what-is-lending-cryptocurrency>What is Lending Cryptocurrency?</h2><p>This mostly applies to coins how follow the Proof of Work consensus model, where there is no way to stake for passive income. You can lend cryptocurrency in a couple different ways. There are centralized platforms like BlockFi that allow you to lend, and there are also decentralized platforms like Aave, which allow you to do practically the same thing. Through staking or lending, you can earn passive income on just about any token.</p><h2 id=what-is-mining-cryptocurrency>What is Mining Cryptocurrency?</h2><p>Now I&rsquo;m sure most people know what mining cryptocurrency is, but mining is another way to verify a blockchain. Proof of Work (Mining) is mostly used by the older coins, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Through mining, you are rewarded through your computer solving complex math problems. Miners get rewarded when a new block is created as well as gas fees. Through these ways, you can make money mining cryptocurrency on any computer. If you are going to do this, I highly recommend not using the computer you use, and instead make a computer especially for mining.</p><h2 id=how-can-i-make-passive-income-playing-games>How Can I Make Passive Income Playing Games?</h2><p>Crypto gaming has recently exploded and has brought a lot of attention to this market. There are hundreds if not thousands of games that you can make money playing. In most of these games you are rewarded with either a cryptocurrency, NFTs, or a combination of both. There are a bunch of great games to play with low barrier to entry, and I have made other posts about them. A couple of my favorite games right now are Dragonary as well as Splinterlands. Through these games, you are able to make daily passive income just through playing.</p><h2 id=summary>Summary</h2><p>Overall, there are plenty of ways to earn passive income in cryptocurrency, and definitely more ways then any other traditional market. Through these methods, you can earn income no matter a bull/bear market, everyday FUD, and anything else that could make the markets take a turn for the worse.</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=/website-investing/posts/what-is-dragonary/ rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is Dragonary?
