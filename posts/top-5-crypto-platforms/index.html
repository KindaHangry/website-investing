For the people that live in the United States, you have to sign up for Binance US. For people who live outside the US, you can use the normal Binance. The difference between these two is Binance US has a much smaller selection of coins, but the tradeoff with that is it is very secure. The normal Binance is pretty much the opposite, with it having a large selection of coins, but it still quite secure. Both are good options to have, both as a beginner and veteran in this space. Attached is a link to sign up for Binance.</p><p><a href="https://accounts.binance.us/en/register?ref=54239640">Sign up for Binance</a></p><h2 id=2-coinbase>2) Coinbase</h2><p>Coinbase is the probably the most popular crypto currency exchange, at least here in the US. It has a decent variety of coins, and is as secure as any centralized exchange. This is most people&rsquo;s first crypto based exchange, and is a great gateway into the rest of the space. Coinbase is by not a bad exchange to use, but it does have some issues. The fees on coinbase are quite high, and they are the highest of any exchange on this list. The counter argument to this is that you can sign up for Coinbase Pro for free, which has significantly lower fees, which is a good option to have. The problem with Coinbase Pro is that the interface is very different from the regular Coinbase, and a bit more complicated. This pushes away the newer investors from using Coinbase Pro and just settling for these higher fees. Overall Coinbase is a good exchange to use. Attached is a link that will get you $10 in free Bitcoin when you signup.</p><p><a href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/bridge_p9a?src=android-link">Sign up for Coinbase</a></p><h2 id=3-etoro>3) eToro</h2><p>eToro is a very well rounded exchange, and a fantastic option for any type of cryptocurrency investor/trader. Their fees are competitive compared to many exchanges, they have a great selection of coins to choose from, and they also have stocks coming soon. Overall a great exchange, especially for newer investors that want to have a lot of options in a single platform. If you want to sign up, I have attached a link to their main website.</p><p><a href=https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-100428808-14080922>Sign up for eToro</a></p><h2 id=4-coinrule>4) Coinrule</h2><p>Coinrile is a relatively new and less known exchange, and is quickly gaining users with its huge increase in marketing. Coinrule is unlike most other platforms on this list, in the fact that it helps trade for you. This platform is for you if you want high returns, but don&rsquo;t necessarily have the time to research every new coin. This way, you can have the best of both worlds. If you want to sign up for them, I have attached a link that will bring you to their sign up page.</p><p><a href=https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100428808-14320504>Sign up for Coinrule</a></p><h2 id=5-kucoin>5) Kucoin</h2><p>Kucoin is also a good exchange, and similar to Gate.io has a very wide variety of coins. Almost any coin is either on Kucoin or Gate.io, making them 2 great exchanges to use. To us Kucoin, you don&rsquo;t even need to verify you&rsquo;re identity, due to it not needing KYC. The tradeoff with this is this exchange is not a very safe place to keep your crypto, which is why I advise everyone to take move their crypto from that Kucoin after buying it. The interface is a little difficult to understand at first, but once you get the hang of it, it is pretty simple. Overall, a decent exchange with a wide variety of coins, but major safety concerns. I have a link to sign up for Kucoin below.</p><p><a href="https://www.kucoin.com/ucenter/signup?rcode=rJL2B36">Sign up for Kucoin</a></p><h2 id=honorable-mentions>Honorable Mentions</h2><p>Gemini - great exchange with a very high level of security, not many different coins</p><p>Robinhood - &ldquo;no fees&rdquo;, but doesn&rsquo;t give you access to withdraw your crypto</p><p>Pancake Swap - decentralized, making it the safest possible way to buy crypto, low fees, wide variety of coins, difficult to use for beginners. I have a video on how to use Pancake Swap here.
