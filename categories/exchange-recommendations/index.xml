If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever tried to sign up for a stock/crypto exchange, you&amp;rsquo;d know that they require Know Your Customer (KYC) verification. A KYC check&amp;rsquo;s purpose is to attempt to verify someone&amp;rsquo;s identity, and almost all major trading platforms/exchanges require it. You&amp;rsquo;ll be asked for things such as your SSN, driver&amp;rsquo;s license, passport, and possibly more. This makes it impossible for someone that&amp;rsquo;s under the age of 18 to create their own account.</description></item><item><title>Top 5 Stock Trading Platforms 2021</title><link>https://kindahangry.github.io/website-investing/posts/top-5-stock-platforms-/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jun 2021 19:47:32 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kindahangry.github.io/website-investing/posts/top-5-stock-platforms-/</guid><description>1) Webull Webull takes the cake in my opinion as a stock trading platform. It has 0 fees, after-hours trading, a pretty simple interface, and you can even trade a selection of cryptocurrencies there. They also have a great deal to new investors that includes up to 4 free stocks, that can be valued up to $1850. Overall, a great platform that I have never had a complaint with, and that&amp;rsquo;s why it takes the number 1 spot on this list.</description></item><item><title>Top 5 Crypto Exchanges 2021</title><link>https://kindahangry.github.io/website-investing/posts/top-5-crypto-platforms/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jun 2021 19:47:32 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kindahangry.github.io/website-investing/posts/top-5-crypto-platforms/</guid><description>1) Binance Depending on where you live, Binance could vary as a top rated exchange. For the people that live in the United States, you have to sign up for Binance US. For people who live outside the US, you can use the normal Binance. The difference between these two is Binance US has a much smaller selection of coins, but the tradeoff with that is it is very secure. The normal Binance is pretty much the opposite, with it having a large selection of coins, but it still quite secure.</description></item></channel></rss>
