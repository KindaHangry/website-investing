What is investing? How do I start investing? What should I invest in? Is investing safe? All of these questions and more will be answered here to help you begin your investing journey

## What Is Investing?

There are a few ways to invest, and a couple of things you can invest. The most notable ways are investing your time and investing your money. In this article, we'll be explaining how to invest your money, and making your money work for you. A very famous quote from Warren Buffet explains this very well, "If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die". This quote is in many ways true and helps emphasize the importance of investing to beginners. There are a few different things you can invest your money into, and it's up to you to decide what you want to invest in. While there are more things you can invest your money into, I recommend choosing from these three. Stocks, cryptocurrency, and yourself. Briefly summarized, stocks are small parts of a company, and owning a companies stock means that you believe they will grow as a business in the future. Cryptocurrencies are not nearly as simple as stocks, and therefore I wouldn't recommend investing in crypto as a complete beginner, due to its volatility and complexity. Once you understand a little more about how investing works, cryptocurrency is an option for you to invest in. Finally, yourself. While this does sound cheesy, investing your money into yourself to learn skills can help you out a lot in the future, especially if you're younger. Overall, you can choose to invest in one, two, or even all of these 3 options.

## How Do I Start Investing?

Now that you understand more about what investing is, we can discuss how to begin investing. First of all, if you're under 18 and wanting to invest, read [this](https://investing-help.com/posts/how-to-invest-under-18/) article because you have different steps than most people. Now, investing in stocks and crypto are pretty similar when it comes to setting up an account. First, you have to sign up for an exchange. For beginners, I'd recommend signing up with [Robinhood](https://join.robinhood.com/seanb710/). First of all, using that link gets both you and me a free stock just by signing up, and this stock can be worth up to $180. Another reason is the simplicity of the app, making it easy for a beginner to purchase their first shares of a company. Finally, you can purchase a few different types of cryptocurrencies on Robinhood as well, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and more. If you want to invest in a wider variety of cryptocurrencies, I recommend [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/bridge_p9a?src=android-link). Using that link to sign up with Coinbase gets you a free $10 in Bitcoin whenever you deposit $100 into your account. Another reason to create an account with Coinbase is, similar to Robinhood, makes the buying and selling of cryptocurrency simple. Another pro for Coinbase is the wide variety of coins it allows you to purchase, and signing up for Coinbase Pro (which is free), gets you an even wider variety of coins. Finally, Coinbase is one of the most secure and scrutinized exchanges, making it the perfect place for any beginner.

## What Should I Invest In?

Now that you understand what investing is and where to start investing, you're ready to begin. If you're looking to invest in stocks, you have a couple of things to decide for yourself. Do you want lower gains, lower volatility, and lower risk, or would you rather have higher gains, higher volatility, and higher risk? There are pros and cons to each of these, and your choice depends on a few different metrics. How much time are you willing to put into investing? If you don't have/want to spend a lot of time researching and are ok with a slow and steady approach, you probably want to invest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and dividend stocks. ETFs are like a basket of different companies, and buying a share in an ETF is like buying a small fraction of 100 different companies. Depending on the ETF, you will see low risk, low volatility, and lower gains. Dividend stocks are stocks that payout money depending on how many shares of that company you own. Dividend stocks bring similar returns as most ETFs, and both are very safe options. If you are willing to put in the time to research companies and are ok with high risk and volatility, then individual stocks are probably your best bet. There are different levels of risk for each stock, so you have to research a company and if you believe in its long-term future, buy some shares in it. There are bigger stocks like Apple and Microsoft that have already passed their growth stage, so there isn't as much potential in them now, making them safer investments with lower returns. If you want even higher returns, you can try and find the next Apple and Microsoft, but doing that takes even more time and even higher risk. For the people who want high risk and high returns, cryptocurrency is another option, although it also takes a lot of work. First, you need to have at least a basic understanding of how blockchain and cryptocurrency works. Once you've done that, start researching specific cryptocurrencies you want to invest in. If you want some help. check out some of my other posts about individual cryptocurrencies. There you can find what each coin is about, what it does, who is leading it, my thoughts on its potential, and more. Overall, what you invest in is up to you and a choice you have to make.

### Is Investing Safe?

Investing can be safe, depending on what choices you make. If you research quality companies/cryptocurrencies, don't sell when the price is low, and keep buying over time, investing is safe. On the other side, if you don't do any research, sell when everyone else is, and throw in all of your money at once, investing is not safe at all. If you make the right choices, investing can be an excellent way to grow your wealth over time.
