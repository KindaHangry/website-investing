## How do you Invest as a Minor?

If you've ever tried to sign up for a stock/crypto exchange, you'd know that they require Know Your Customer (KYC) verification. A KYC check's purpose is to attempt to verify someone's identity, and almost all major trading platforms/exchanges require it. You'll be asked for things such as your SSN, driver's license, passport, and possibly more. This makes it impossible for someone that's under the age of 18 to create their own account. Depending on what you want to invest in, there are a few ways to get past this.

## Do You Want to Invest in Stocks as a Minor?

If you want to invest in stocks, you have an extra option compared to someone wanting to invest in crypto. There are 2 ways to invest in stocks as a minor, either you ask a parent/guardian to make an account for you, or you create a custodial account. A custodial account is an account that is created by your parent, but when you reach 18 the account's ownership will be transferred to you. There are pros and cons to each of these methods. The first method means that you'll have many more options in choosing your trading platform. Not every platform has an option for custodial accounts, making selections limited. On the other hand, the account created by your parent that you use will be taxed in their tax bracket, as well as they technically own the account. If you want to create a custodial account, you also have some pros and cons. As I stated earlier, not every stock trading platform has an option for custodial accounts, making your selections somewhat limited. A few platforms that I'd recommend for custodial accounts include Charles Schwab, ETrade, as well as TD Ameritrade. The pro for custodial accounts is that you aren't taxed at all up to your first $2,000 a year in gains. Once you pass the $2,000 made in a single year, you are taxed at your parents' bracket. Another benefit is that once you reach 18 you receive ownership of your account Overall, I'd recommend, a custodial account to minors, but either way works.

## Do You Want to Invest in Crypto as a Minor?

If you want to invest in crypto as a minor, you have 2 options. First of all, you can sign up for any major exchange with your parent/guardian's credentials. My personal two recommendations for crypto exchanges would have to be [Binance](https://accounts.binance.us/en/register?ref=54239640) and [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/bridge_p9a?src=android-link). These two exchanges have quite a few different tokens, allow you to transfer your crypto, are very secure, and you'll get a free $10 of Bitcoin if you sign up for [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/bridge_p9a?src=android-link) with this link. If this isn't an option for you, there is another method, although it does take a bit more work. You'll first need to download Trust Wallet, which you can do by simply looking it up in the app store. Once you have the app downloaded, you must create your first wallet. When creating your first wallet, the most important part is to keep your key phrase in a secure place (I recommend writing it down and keeping the paper in a safe place). If someone is able to find out your wallet's private key, they can easily steal everything in your wallet. Once you have your wallet created, you will see 3 options under your wallet's current balance, send, receive, and buy. You will then want to tap buy, choose whichever crypto you want, and enter your payment method. Once you've finalized the order, you will receive whatever crypto you bought. Once you've done this, you have a couple of options with what to do with your crypto. You can simply keep what you just bought, connect your wallet to Uniswap/PancakeSwap if you want to exchange your crypto for another, or send it to [KuCoin](https://www.kucoin.com/ucenter/signup?rcode=rJL2B36) to buy whatever you can't with the other options. [KuCoin](https://www.kucoin.com/ucenter/signup?rcode=rJL2B36) is one of the few crypto exchanges that all you need is an email and password to sign up for. The downside to using KuCoin is that it isn't very secure, so if you were going to buy on KuCoin I'd recommend buying your token of choice, and immediately sending it to your Trust Wallet, which is much more secure. While buying crypto without asking your parent/guardian to make you an account is possible, it does take much more work. If you want a simpler explanation of this process, I have attached a video that may help.
