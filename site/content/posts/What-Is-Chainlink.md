## What is Chainlink?

Chainlink is an oracle token that links the real world to the blockchain. Chainlink is used on smart contract platforms to make smart contracts more expansive in the things that can be coded into them. For example, in a sports betting scenario, the betting odds would change if one team had a large point advantage over another. This is where Chainlink comes in. Chainlink allows these contracts to use information in the outside world. Without any oracle, the odds would stay the same, even if one team was winning by an astronomical amount. Chainlink is the leading oracle in the space by far, and will dominate the oracle space in the long term.

## What Problem Is It Solving?

Without oracles in the smart contract space, blockchains such as Ethereum, Polkadot and many more wouldn't be able to use their smart contracts in nearly as many ways. These oracles allow a huge increase in the variety of smart contracts that can be developed. Chainlink could be a huge reason for mainstream cryptocurrency adoption, which is why I have such high belief in it.

## The Development Team

The Chainlink development team is one of the better ones, having all of it's members being extremely qualified. They have developers that have been following crypto since the Bitcoin whitepaper first came out, Cornell and MIT graduates, blockchain developers, and even more. They are a very trustworthy and qualified team that I believe can lead Chainlink to the future.

## Upcoming Events and News

Chainlink doesn't really have many more serious upgrades left. Similar to Vechain, Chainlink is mainly working on getting new partnerships with different blockchains. By doing this, Chainlink can expand it's reach and keep it's position as the predominate oracle.
