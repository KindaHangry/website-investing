## What is Chainlink?

Chainlink is an oracle token that links the real world to the blockchain. Chainlink is used on smart contract platforms to make smart contracts more expansive in the things that can be coded into them. For example, in a sports betting scenario, the betting odds would change if one team had a large point advantage over another. This is where Chainlink comes in. Chainlink allows these contracts to use information in the outside world. Without any oracle, the odds would stay the same, even if one team was winning by an astronomical amount. Chainlink is the leading oracle in the space by far, and will dominate the oracle space in the long term.

## What Problem Is It Solving?



## The Development Team

Vechain is led by it's two co-founders, Sunny Lu and Jay Zhang. Sunny Lu has extensive experience in this space. He has over 15 years of IT experience in Fortune 500 companies, and he was the former CIO of Louis Vuitton. Both Sunny and Jay created Vechain back in 2015, and since then it has blossomed into what is is today. The rest of the team are well trained developers that have been improving Vechain for years. Overall, the team looks capable of growing Vechain into what we all hope it will become.

## Upcoming Events and News

Vechain doesn't really have many upgrades left, as it's technology is already in great condition. The big events that Vechain still has are it's partnership announcements. Just recently, there were rumours of a possible Salesforce partnership, which still hasn't been confirmed. Vechain does already have some big partnerships, that will help other companies trust Vechain, but these are baby steps compared to what may come. Overall, Vechain is a very promising project that could grow into something much bigger than it currently is.
