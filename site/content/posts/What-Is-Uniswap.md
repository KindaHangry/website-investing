## What is Uniswap?

Uniswap is a DeFi token that is used to decentralize swapping coins. It is very similar to Pancakeswap, with the big difference being that one is built on the Binance Smart Chain, and the other is built on the Ethereum blockchain. Uniswap has been the most used decentralized exchange (DEX) for a while, do to the fact that it leads all other Ethereum DEXs.

## What Problem Is It Solving?

The goal of blockchain is decentralization, and projects like Uniswap help decentralize the process of trading and swapping coins. More recently another big DEX on the Binance Smart Chain called Pancakeswap has been stealing market share because it has much lower gas fees. At its peak, Uniswap transactions were several hundred dollars. While it is much lower than it once was, gas fees are still a big problem for Uniswap. These fees are caused by the congestion on the Ethereum blockchain, which people are hoping will be fixed in the near future.

## The Development Team

Uniswap was created and developed by Hayden Adams, a former mechanical engineer at Siemens. Adams didn't have much experience in the blockchain space before this, but was able to successfully create the leading DEX. Uniswap was created in 2018, and has flourished ever since

## Upcoming Events and News

Uniswap doesn't have any planned events, but is instead lead by its voting governance system. Holders of Uniswap can both propose and vote on proposals created by developers. When a proposal gets a majroity of voters saying yes, they are given funding to work on their proposal. Once these proposals are coded, they are implemented into the Uniswap protocol. This is a fantastic way to upgrade a platform, due to it being led by the people and the users of the Uniswap protocol.
