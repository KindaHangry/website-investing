Stellar calls themselves, "an open network for money", and this network may very well be the future of transacting with any currency. Similar to XRP, they both focus on transacting money, with their high speeds and low costs, yet the visions behind both projects are very different. We'll talk about what exactly Stellar is, the problem it's solving, the development team behind the project, the likely future of Stellar, and even a price prediction.

## What is Stellar?

Stellar is a decentralized open network that can be used by anyone to transfer any currency anywhere. It's similar to apps like Cashapp and Venmo, with some key differences being decentralization, can send/exchange many more currencies, and being more accessible. Using Stellar, you can send someone in Europe US dollars, which will be converted to euros for them. Stellar manages to do this and maintain decentralization by allowing businesses to run nodes for them. So say I wanted to send someones in India some money. I could send US dollars, they'd receive their native currency, and they could receive that currency from a local vendor that runs a node. It doesn't just have to be fiat currency that you are sending. You can send this using other cryptos, or even commodities such as gold and silver. This allows Stellar to maintain decentralization while allowing an open network of currency.

## What Problem Is It Solving?

Connectivity is one of the most impactful advances that technology has brought us. You can talk to a family member in Portugal while you're living in Iceland. The next step of this cycle is this level of connectivity when it comes to money. This will also impact the smaller countries with not as much access to different types of money as we do. This may very well be the next step in technology, and Stellar may be the leader of it.

## The Development Team

The Stellar team is led by its founder David Mazières. David has extreme prowess in the computer science field, with him having a Ph.D. and graduating from MIT in computer science. Their CEO Denelle Dixon also has experience in leading organizations, due to her experience as the chief operating officer of Mozilla Corporation. Before Mozilla, she worked with private equity firm Terra Firma as its director of U.S. legal strategy and Yahoo as its senior legal director. The only possible weakness I see here is a lack of blockchain experience in the head roles, but I'm sure the rest of the team makes up for that.


## Upcoming Events and News

Stellar does have a roadmap for 2021, but not any concrete details. Their goals for this year are, supporting the robustness and usability of Stellar, help Stellar be the blockchain people know and trust, and foster and develop sustainable Stellar use cases for cross-border payments and securitized assets. The big event Stellar does have planned for 2021 is Meridian, which will occur in November. "Meridian 2021 will serve as a forum where experts in finance, policy, and technology from within and beyond the Stellar ecosystem will share what they’re building and their plans for growth. By connecting on Stellar, these developers and companies are working effectively and collectively to have a global impact, bringing the world closer to true financial inclusion", and this is on the Stellar website. This can serve as a fantastic opportunity for Stellar to grow and complete its mission

## Price Prediction

The XLM token reached an all-time high (ATH) of $.93 back in January of 2018. Even during this bull run, XLM is yet to break that ATH, and topped out around $.73 in May of this year. This is unusual because almost every other major token has crushed its old ATH, except for a select few like XRP and XLM. This can mean one of two things, either there has been a major problem that has occurred, similar to the XRP lawsuit by the SEC, or it was lagging behind the rest of the market and hadn't quite broken its ATH. There has been no groundbreaking case against XLM, giving us one answer. It may not break this ATH this year, but assuming we are still in a bull market, it is likely that XLM still has a far way to go. So my price target for XLM for now is its once ATH of $.93. If it breaks that level it can easily go much higher, but for now, we'll have to see.

## Final Thoughts

Stellar may very well lead the future of "open money", and if you agree with what Stellar is doing and see a future, this may be a great project. Stellar does have a great problem that it's solving and can lead to some serious upside, in the long and short term. Overall, this is a solid project that has everything you need in a bull case and could be a great thing to invest in.
