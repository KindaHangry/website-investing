## What is PancakeSwap?

PancakeSwap is a DeFi token that is used to decentralize swapping coins. PancakeSwap is built and is the biggest DEX (Decentralized Exchange) on the Binance Smart Chain. Pancake Swap works by using Binance Smart Chain coins in your cryptocurrency wallet, and swaps that into the chosen token. You can only swap BSC tokens (Binance Smart Chain) into other tokens on the BSC. You can also stake your Pancake Swap tokens for around 120% APY. You can use any wallet, although in my opinion Trust Wallet is the easiest. Attached is a video I made on how to connect your Trust Wallet to Pancake Swap.

## What Problem Is It Solving?

The goal of blockchain is decentralization, and projects like PancakeSwap help decentralize the process of trading and swapping coins. Another big problem in the DEX space is the crazy high gas fees on the Ethereum blockchain, which is why the BSC DEXs are getting so much volume right now. Uniswap is another DEX that is similar to PancakeSwap, although Uniswap is built on the Ethereum blockchain. With the Ethereum blockchain being so congested recently, the gas fees have been insane, even getting as high as 500 dollars, and even more for a single transaction. On the other hand, PancakeSwap transactions are almost always less than a dollar, sometimes even going down to 20-50 cents. This is bringing a lot of traffic to the BSC and especially PancakeSwap. For these two main reasons, PancakeSwap looks like a great project.

## The Development Team

PancakeSwap has an anonymous team, which is a red flag. While their exact reasons for being anonymous are unknown, anonymous teams are always something to be careful with because they can easily rug pull the coin and would have no real-life consequences. While I doubt that is the case with PancakeSwap, it is still something to be careful with. The reason why I'm not too worried about an anonymous team when it comes to PancakeSwap is that they could've scammed everyone already, with this cryptocurrencies market cap in the billions. They have also built great technology in this swapping platform, and I find it hard to believe that they'd rug pull this project. While it is always possible, I don't believe this DEX is a scam.

## Upcoming Events and News

PancakeSwap is already a mostly finished DEX, and therefore doesn't have many more upgrades. Other than maintenance, there aren't many big events that we currently know of when it comes to PancakeSwap. The next obstacle for PancakeSwap is getting more volume coming to them, which will drive up the price. Due to the staking aspect of the CAKE token and its strong fundamentals, this is a great project to hold for the long term.
