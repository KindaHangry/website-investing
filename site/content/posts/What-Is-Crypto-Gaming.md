Cryptocurrency gaming is a newer niche in the crypto space, and can be a great way to make some money. Today, weâ€™ll talk about what exactly crypto gaming is, how it works, and some good games to look into.

## What is Crypto Gaming?

Crypto gaming is a new way for people to make money through video games. Through crypto gaming, you can earn NFTs or crypto, both of which you can sell. Not all games have both NFTs and crypto, so do a little bit of research into exactly what game you're getting into. The bigger games have their own NFT marketplaces, where you can buy, sell, and trade your NFTs. The only issue with crypto gaming is that it's not always very consistent. The money you can make on a game very much depends on it's popularity, so if a game suddenly loses players, the items you earn won't be worth nearly as much. Another downside is unless you get in very early, it can take a decent amount of money to get started. The later you get in, the more expensive it'll be. While these can be two downsides to crypto gaming, this is still a great way that you can make some money through gaming.

## How it Works?

Crypto gaming is pretty simple to get into. You need a wallet that is supported by whatever blockchain the game is on. Most games are on the Ethereum blockchain, so you'll need a metamask wallet. For games on other blockchains, you'll need to create another wallet. Once you've connected your wallet, you download the game from their website. Now, for some games you will need something to begin, which can cost some money depending on how early you are. For example, the current most popular game, Axie Infinity, requires you have 3 Axies to play the game. These can cost you a few hundred dollars each, but prices will change with market demand. If you can manage to get into a smaller game earlier, upfront costs will be much lower. Once you've met these steps, you're good to go.
