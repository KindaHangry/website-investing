## What is Dogecoin?

Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that doesn't have any functionality. Dogecoin is a fork of the Litecoin blockchain and has no utility outside of that.  It follows a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus model as well as it being an inflationary coin. Overall, this is a joke of a coin that is by no means a good investment.

## What Problem Is It Solving?

There is no problem that Dogecoin is solving directly. You will hear Dogecoin bulls make the argument that similar to how the dollar was created, Dogecoin will follow. Long ago before the dollar bill was used, gold was the trading currency that people would use to buy and sell goods. The problem with using gold was it was too heavy and difficult to transact in. The dollar bill was created as a fiat version of gold to fix these problems. Dogecoin supporters will claim that we are going through the same situation, except Bitcoin is gold and Dogecoin is the dollar. This claim does have some merit due to Bitcoin's slow speed, high fees, and environmental impact, although Dogecoin also has the problems to a point. There are coins much better suited to doing the job than Dogecoin is. Another problem is Dogecoin bulls believe Dogecoin will replace the US dollar. I highly doubt any cryptocurrency will ever replace the current dollar, although what is much more likely is a stable coin backed and created by the government. Overall, Dogecoin has no real problem that it is solving.

## The Development Team

The development team of Dogecoin consists of Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer. These two created this coin in 2013 as a joke that they believed would never turn into anything. These 2 creators didn't make the coin with any real intent of improving it, instead creating it off of a whim and not planning to do anything with it. It stayed this way until it began to pick up traction in early 2021. Around this time Elon Musk began tweeting about how Dogecoin was his favorite coin. This caused an artificial spike in the price due to Elon's remarks. He kept talking about Doge, further increasing its price, and even spoke about it during his Saturday Night Live debut. The creators were baffled by this insane change in events since they'd forgot that they even created this coin.

## Tokenomics

Unfortunately, the tokenomics of Dogecoin are just as bad as the fundamentals of it. To begin with, there are billions of Dogecoin created every year that are added into the market, bringing massive inflation with it. This coin has now max supply, meaning it will forever grow in supply. This means that demand will have to equally increase with the inflation levels just to keep the price flat. Furthermore, the top Dogecoin wallet owns 30% of the entire supply, easily allowing them to dump the price whenever they please. Dogecoin is a fork of the Litecoin blockchain, making it a copy of Litecoin with a different name. For all of these reasons and more, Dogecoin is by no means a coin you want to seriously invest in.

## Upcoming Events and News

Dogecoin has no upgrades planned for any time in the future. The closest thing to an upgrade that has been announced was an Elon tweet about how he was talking to the Dogecoin developers about how to improve Doge. All news and events are driven by Elon Musk, and not predictable by any means. For all we know, Elon will get bored of Dogecoin and never talk about it again, which would completely end it. What most people fail to realize is that this coin's price is 100% driven by the famous people that promote it. There are no concrete future upgrades or plans for Doge, making it a horrible investment for the future.
