## What is Aave?

Aave is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that allows people to lend out as well as borrow their cryptocurrency. This allows them to avoid the centralized way of doing it, while at the same time saving more. You can either lend out crypto you already own for interest back on it, or you could borrow cryptocurrency while paying a fee. Aave is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), meaning that it is governed by the Aave token holders. Aave works by using smart contracts to confirm people wanting to lend/borrow. The issue with borrowing cryptocurrency is it is very volatile, making the collateral the borrower puts up change in value frequently. To fix this, DeFi platforms require collateral greater than the price of what you are borrowing. If the price of the collateral plummets, the collateral will be liquidated to cover the amount that was borrowed.

## What Problem Is It Solving?

DeFi is one of the most important and undervalued sectors in cryptocurrency. The goal of blockchain is decentralization, while the token uses that decentralization for its own purposes. Aave is no different, as it decentralizes the finance system. Currently, the only way to borrow money is from a bank or some lending company, which acquired that money from someone else. DeFi cuts out the middle man (the banks or other lending companies) from the equation, bringing lower fees to the borrower, higher interest rates to the lender, and more security, via decentralization. 

## The Aave Team

The Aave founder is Stani Kulechov. Kulechov is a seasoned entrepreneur with extensive experience in the fields of blockchain and crypto. Stani is also a mentor to many founders and advisors of ICOs and blockchain projects and has spoken at numerous FinTech, Blockchain, and cryptocurrency events, particularly on topics related to Ethereum Smart Contracts. While there are developers, most of Aave is run by the token holders, via the DAO model. The holders vote on changes to the Aave protocol, leaving decisions to the people who are directly affected by them.

## Upcoming Events and News

Aave doesn't have many planned upcoming events, since most of the decisions are decided by the token holders. Also, this technology is functional and mostly just needs tweaks and smaller upgrades. The next big obstacle Aave faces is mainstream adoption. Once people understand the technology, billions of dollars will flood to Aave and similar projects, which is where Aave still has exponential growth
