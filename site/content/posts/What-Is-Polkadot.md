## What is Polkadot?

Polkadot is a smart contract platform that is built to be interoperable. In the far future, I think similar to the current technology giants, there won't be a single winner. This is why interoperability is so important. Blockchains must be able to work with each other, because without that ability, they will be left in the past. Polkadot already has smart contracts enabled, and is already rolling out it's parachains. Polkadot also has a fantastic ecosystem that is still growing. In terms of fundamentals, Polkadot is one of the leading smart contract blockchains that may be one of the leaders in the space even in the coming years.

## What Problem Is It Solving?

Similar to other smart contract platforms, Polkadot is meant to increase the capabilities of blockchains. These smart contract platforms are some of the best projects to invest in, because this is such a vital space to the future of blockchains. As I stated earlier, I doubt there will be a single winner. Instead, there will be a variety of tokens and platforms used for different purposes. I believe Polkadot will be one of those platforms, leading the smart contract space. Picking a winner right now is like trying to pick one Amazon or Google from the hundreds of companies that went public during the .com bubble. While it is by no means guaranteed, Polkadot is currently one of the heads of the smart contract space, and has a good chance of retaining that spot.

## The Development Team

Similar to Cardano, Polkadot is also led by a co-founder of Ethereum. Dr. Gavin Wood is a co-founder of Polkadot, and was around Ethereum since the early days. Wood left Ethereum to attempt to build his own unique smart contract blockchain, and that's exactly what he did. Wood alongside Robert Habermeier and Peter Czaban created Polkadot, and ever since then it has blossomed into what it is today. The rest of the team consists of similar minded people that work to improve Polkadot. This is a great team with a huge amount of experience in the space.


## Upcoming Events and News

Polkadot has it's big parachain auctions coming up later this year, which will allow projects to build upon the Polkadot platform. The best way to think of parachains are branches from a tree. These branches are built off of Polkadot, and they are what different projects use to build their own tokens. These parachain auctions will bring more projects to the Polkadot space, further increasing it's ecosystem. This is both a huge price catalyst as well as a big moment for Polkadot. If these projects really like building on Polkadot, this will open the floodgates to all sorts of others.
