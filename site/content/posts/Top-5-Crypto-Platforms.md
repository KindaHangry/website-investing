## 1) Binance

Depending on where you live, Binance could vary as a top rated exchange. For the people that live in the United States, you have to sign up for Binance US. For people who live outside the US, you can use the normal Binance. The difference between these two is Binance US has a much smaller selection of coins, but the tradeoff with that is it is very secure. The normal Binance is pretty much the opposite, with it having a large selection of coins, but it still quite secure. Both are good options to have, both as a beginner and veteran in this space. Attached is a link to sign up for Binance.

## 2) Coinbase 

Coinbase is the probably the most popular crypto currency exchange, at least here in the US. It has a decent variety of coins, and is as secure as any centralized exchange. This is most people's first crypto based exchange, and is a great gateway into the rest of the space. Coinbase is by not a bad exchange to use, but it does have some issues. The fees on coinbase are quite high, and they are the highest of any exchange on this list. The counter argument to this is that you can sign up for Coinbase Pro for free, which has significantly lower fees, which is a good option to have. The problem with Coinbase Pro is that the interface is very different from the regular Coinbase, and a bit more complicated. This pushes away the newer investors from using Coinbase Pro and just settling for these higher fees. Overall Coinbase is a good exchange to use. Attached is a link that will get you $10 in free Bitcoin when you signup.

## 3) Gate.io

Gate.io is a very good exchange and is a veteran in the crypto currency space. They have been around for a while now, with their vast amount of choices when it comes to coins, good security, and low fees. This exchange is really great all around, except for one problem. The sign-up security check is quite extensive, and asks for the same thing as any other exchange (driver's license, ssn, etc...) but also your work and job information. Other than that, it is a fantastic exchange that is good for anyone once you get the hang of it, new or experienced.

## 4) Crypto.com

Crypto.com is a relatively new exchange, and is quickly gaining users with its huge increase in marketing. This is also a great exchange I'd recommend, for it's decently large variety of coins, good safety, and debit card options. Crypto.com is similar to Coinbase Pro. They have a somewhat comparable variety of coins, similar fees, and similar levels of security. Crypto.com also allows you to get a debit card, once you have a certain amount of money on the exchange. The great thing about this card is that it gives you cashback on your purchases. What makes this card better than most other cards is it's cashback return and it allows you to pay with your crypto. Overall, another great exchange that I'd definitely recommend.

## 5) Kucoin

Kucoin is also a good exchange, and similar to Gate.io has a very wide variety of coins. Almost any coin is either on Kucoin or Gate.io, making them 2 great exchanges to use. To us Kucoin, you don't even need to verify you're identity, due to it not needing KYC. The tradeoff with this is this exchange is not a very safe place to keep your crypto, which is why I advise everyone to take move their crypto from that Kucoin after buying it. The interface is a little difficult to understand at first, but once you get the hang of it, it is pretty simple. Overall, a decent exchange with a wide variety of coins, but major safety concerns. I have a link to sign up for Kucoin below.

## Honorable Mentions
Gemini - great exchange with a very high level of security, not many different coins

Robinhood - "no fees", but doesn't give you access to withdraw your crypto

Pancake Swap - decentralized, making it the safest possible way to buy crypto, low fees, wide variety of coins, difficult to use for beginners
