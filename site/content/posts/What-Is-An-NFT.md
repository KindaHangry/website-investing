## What is an NFT?
		
An NFT is short for a non-fungible token, which means a digital piece that cannot be replaced, making it completely unique. An NFT can be anything from a piece of artwork to a clip of Tom Brady throwing a touchdown. You can relate an NFT to a baseball card, or some sort of other collectible item. Both examples are unique items that cannot be replaced. A common misunderstanding of NFTs is that you can simply take a screenshot of them, and then you own that NFT as well. What if someone made a fake Lebron James basketball card, and claimed it was the real thing? No one wants to buy a fake card, and you can relate this to NFTS. Through blockchain technology, each NFT is verified and minted so there is no chance of a fake being created. Another criticism is that the reason people buy collectible items and art is that you can hold and physically see them. The truth of the matter is that technology continues to be an ever-growing factor in our lives. NFTs may very well one day become the new way to buy art, show off collectibles, and even digitally own your favorite moments.

## How do they work?	

As I touched on earlier, NFTs are created and minted through some sort of smart contract platform such as Ethereum. Anyone can make an NFT through an NFT marketplace such as Rarible. Once an NFT is created, the creator has the option to sell it, keep it, or send it to someone else. Similar to cryptocurrency, NFTs can be easily transferred to a different wallet. NFTs can be bought on any marketplace through the native currency of the blockchain that was used to create it, and this is usually Ethereum. Another thing to keep in mind is that when a creator mints an NFT, they can decide if they want more than 1 copy of it.
		
 ## Why do NFTs matter?

At this point, NFTs are mostly speculation, but they are also collectible items. NFTs are an easy way to support an artist, whether its a meme, card, video, artwork, or even a tweet. NFTs may very well be a huge part of the inevitable digital future that is approaching, and is also a fun way to digitally own a favorite moment. Overall, there is a lot of potential in NFTs, and this space is continuing to grow by the day.
