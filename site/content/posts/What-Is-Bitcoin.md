## What is Polkadot?

Polkadot 

## What Problem Is It Solving?

The problem Vechain is solving is a big one, being supply chain management. Just one example of this is the huge fake wine problem. The wine fraud market is estimated to be around a 3 billion dollar industry. Vechain could easily solve this problem, by allowing the manufacturer, the store, and the consumer to all have knowledge of where this wine came from. Even this is just one small area where Vechain could truly shine. The question that a lot of people bring up is, "If this technology is so great, why doesn't every big business use it?". The answer to this question is how new this technology is. Even with how new it is, big companies are already beginning to use Vechain. As trust builds and more and more companies begin to partner with Vechain, bigger companies will trust it enough to use it for themselves. At that point, every big company that needs it will be forced into using it, for if they don't they will fall behind their competition.

## The Development Team

Vechain is led by it's two co-founders, Sunny Lu and Jay Zhang. Sunny Lu has extensive experience in this space. He has over 15 years of IT experience in Fortune 500 companies, and he was the former CIO of Louis Vuitton. Both Sunny and Jay created Vechain back in 2015, and since then it has blossomed into what is is today. The rest of the team are well trained developers that have been improving Vechain for years. Overall, the team looks capable of growing Vechain into what we all hope it will become.

## Upcoming Events and News

Vechain doesn't really have many upgrades left, as it's technology is already in great condition. The big events that Vechain still has are it's partnership announcements. Just recently, there were rumours of a possible Salesforce partnership, which still hasn't been confirmed. Vechain does already have some big partnerships, that will help other companies trust Vechain, but these are baby steps compared to what may come. Overall, Vechain is a very promising project that could grow into something much bigger than it currently is.
