## What is Theta?

 Theta is a decentralized video streaming service that is built to revolutionize the video streaming space. There are two Theta tokens, there is Theta and Theta Fuel. Theta is the governance token, while Theta Fuel is what is used to power the platform. 

## What Problem Is It Solving?

Theta is focusing on fixing a few different problems. Currently, video streaming services such as Youtube, Twitch, Hulu, and Netflix all are centralized, have some sort of fee/ad system to make them money, and poor infrastructure. Theta is aiming to fix these problems, with a decentralized way for creators of any level to stream their videos on. There are big perks for using Theta, for both the consumer, and creator. Creators make more money, due to the decentralization aspect of Theta, and consumers pay less. As Theta achieves more mainstream adoption, more creators will be on the Theta platform. The goal is to combine big platforms such as Twitch, Youtube, and Netflix to create one decentralized platform that helps the people.

## The Development Team

Theta is led by its two co-founders, Mitch Liu and Jieyi Long. Jieyi has a Ph.D. in computer engineering, as well as developed multiple patented technologies including VR live streaming as well as instant replays for video games. Mitch has an MBA and was a co-founder of both Gameview Studios and Tapjoy. Theta is advised by two huge names, the co-founder of Youtube, Steven Chen, and Justin Kan, co-founder of Twitch. This team has qualified people in the development space, as well as huge names that have already been successful in this business once before. Out of most of the cryptocurrency teams out there, this one is one of the more qualified. 

## Upcoming Events and News

On June 30th of this year, the Theta Mainnet 3.0 upgrade will be deployed. This upgrade will introduce Tfuel Staking and Uptime Mining, which is a huge incentive for people to hold their token. Other than that, they have a few more big events planned for this year, such as the ThetaDrop Marketplace, V2 Advanced Smart Contracts, V2 Edgecast fully decentralized streaming D-App, and an official Theta app for the Ledger/Trezor. These are just a few of the many upgrades Theta will be having this year, all of which will push Theta towards more mainstream adoption.
